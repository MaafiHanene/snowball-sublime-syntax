# Snowball Sytax definition for Sublime Text 3
I made this initially for personal use to work on the [Arabic stemmer](https://github.com/snowballstem/snowball/blob/master/algorithms/arabic/stem_Unicode.sbl) since I looked around and can't find any editor that has a highlight for editing snowball stemmers. 

### Install
Drop the `Snowball.sublime-syntax` file into your Packages folder (Preferences > Browse Packagesâ€¦).
